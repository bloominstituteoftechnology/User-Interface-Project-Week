                <p>So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. It all happens automatically. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring.</p>
                <p>Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Just a little indication. Let's build an almighty mountain.</p>

                                    <p>A beautiful little sunset. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We need dark in order to show light.</p>
                                    <p>Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. And maybe, maybe, maybe... We don't have anything but happy trees here. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring.</p>
                                    <p>We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Only eight colors that you need. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. At home you have unlimited time. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.</p>
                                    <p>Have fun with it. This is your world. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.</p>

                                    <p>You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning.</p>
                                    <p>And right there you got an almighty cloud. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.</p>
                                    <p>Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. And just raise cain. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.</p>
                                    <p>Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Use what you see, don't plan it. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.</p>

                                    <p>And just raise cain. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart.</p>
                                    <p>I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Learn when to stop. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.</p>
                                    <p>All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Let's do it again then, what the heck. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants.</p>
